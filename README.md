## Running Your First Cozmo Application

Anki have some great documentation to getting you started. Refer to [Anki Cozmo SDK Documentation](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/index.html).

I suggest the following the _Getting Started With the Cozmo SDK_ guide which is the high-level guide to installing and getting your first program started. There are videos throughout the guides to help.
